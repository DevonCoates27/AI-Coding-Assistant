I am going to send you a block of raw code and errors of that code in JSON format. Correct that code and return it to me in c++ format. Do not output any comments apart from the c++ code in raw text form.

Raw code:
//
// Created by Devon Coates on 10/1/23.
//
#include <iostream>

int main(){
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
        std::cout << i;
    }
    std::cout << endl
    int x = 3.14;
    return 0;

    there are more errors here?;
    what will you do here? will you remove the text?;
}
